        Hi Iâ€™m Alex and I thank you for taking the time to visit my webpage, in this section of my website I will be discussing my hobbies, achievements and many other things that I feel you should know about me. 
I went to school to Carshalton Boys Sports college from the years 2010 to 2016 where I learned many valuable lessons such as friendship, discipline and most importantly sport. Sport is a huge part of my life and was something I was always very good at, most specifically handball. I began playing handball in year 7 and carried on up until today, I play for Carshalton Titans one of the best teams in the country, as a team we won the national division and were crowned national champions and came runners up in the national cup. I also used to play a lot of football as a youth and had a regular place in the first team at high school.

         Other activities that I enjoy include supporting my favourite football team Fulham, socialising with friends and going to concerts and festivals. I have supported Fulham since I was a young boy ad have been a season ticket holder since 2014, I go to games regularly and will always try to get tickets to away games when I can. Other than Fulham my second-best thing to do with my spare time is spend time with friends, whether this be going out and playing football or going to places around London such as museums and art galleries.
